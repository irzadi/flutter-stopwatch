# stopwatch

My project to relearn Flutter in 2023.
Using Flutter 3.0.
Learning from Flutter Cookbook by Simone Alessandria

This is a simple app. 
A stopwatch with stop, start and reset buttons
A ListTile widget at the bottom to display all the laps.

The main things I've learned from this app is managing states as well as refactoring (extract Method is awesome!) since the program has finally grown to be larger than 100-200 lines.
